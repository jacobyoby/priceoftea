# Price of TSE Stock in China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

This Python application fetches the price of TSE (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited) stock in the US market, converts it to Chinese Yuan (CNY), and generates a line chart to visualize the stock price in both currencies over time. The application also stores the price data in a CSV file. ðŸ“ˆ

## Prerequisites

1. Register for an API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).
2. Install Python 3.x with pip.
3. Install required modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Features

- Fetches current stock prices from the Alpha Vantage API for a given symbol.
- Converts the stock price from USD to Chinese Yuan (CNY).
- Saves the fetched data (time, price in USD, price in CNY) to a CSV file.
- Generates a line chart using the saved data to visualize the stock price in USD and CNY over time.

## Running the Application

### Clone the Repository

1. Install Git on your machine if you haven't already. You can download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Clone the repository by running the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jacobyoby/priceoftea.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the newly cloned `priceoftea` directory:

   ```
   cd priceoftea
   ```

### Using Python

1. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the `main.py` file with the following contents:

   ```
   STOCK_SYMBOL={symbol}
   API_KEY={your-alphavantage-API-key}
   ```

   Replace `{symbol}` with the stock symbol you want to fetch the data for and `{your-alphavantage-API-key}` with your Alpha Vantage API key.

2. Run the script using `python main.py`.

The script will now fetch the data, store it in the CSV file, and generate a graph using the fetched data.

### Using Docker

1. Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already. You can download Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/get-started
2. Make sure you are in the `priceoftea` directory where the Dockerfile, Python script, and `.env` file are located.
3. Build the Docker image by running the following command:

   ```
   docker build -t jacobedurham/priceoftea-python:latest .
   ```

4. After the build is successful, run the Docker container with the following command:

   ```
   docker run -p 8000:8000 jacobedurham/priceoftea-python:latest
   ```

The application should now be running inside the Docker container, and you can interact with it through the exposed port 8000.
