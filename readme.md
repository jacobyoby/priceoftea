# The Price of T(itanium) in China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ 

This Python script fetches the price of TSE (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited) stock in the US market and converts it to Chinese Yuan (CNY). It generates a CSV file to store the price data and creates a line chart to visualize the stock price in USD and CNY over time. ðŸ“ˆ

- Saves the fetched data (time, price in USD, price in CNY) to a CSV file.
- Generates a line chart using the saved data to visualize the stock price in USD and CNY over time.

## Running the script

1. Create `.env` file in the same directory as main.py file with the following contents: 
	```
	STOCK_SYMBOL={symbol}

	``` 
	where `{symbol}` is the stock symbol you want to fetch the data for.
